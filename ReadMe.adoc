One stop place to have things up and running

== Setup
=== VCS(Git)
The steps below should work for any git based vcs.
[NOTE]
====
Only for ensimag gitlab:
----
sudo echo -n | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect gitlab.ensimag.fr:443 2>/dev/null | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' | sudo tee -a /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
----

There's an issue with certificate used by ensimag's gitlab, hence, you need to run the above command to allow your git to talk to ensimag's gitlab.
